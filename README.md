# IDFS-Project: Pathfinding Visualization with Python

This repository presents a pathfinding project utilizing the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDFS) algorithm. The visualization, created with Tkinter in Python, allows users to interactively observe the algorithm's execution on a map. 

## Features

- **IDFS Algorithm**: Implementing Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search for optimal pathfinding.
- **Tkinter Visualization**: Interactive map visualization with Tkinter for user-friendly experience.
- **Python Implementation**: Built entirely in Python, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the Python script to start the visualization.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahaji-2003/IDFS-Map-Project.git
cd IDFS-Map-Project
python main.py
